SMB3R Flag Randomizer 1.2
By MaCobra52

Notes: 
-Be sure Java is installed on your machine prior to running.
-These flags are only compatible with fcoughlin's (Fred's) SMB3 Randomizer


Instructions:

1. Double Click "SMB3R Flags Randomizer.exe"
2. If this is your first time running the Flags Randomizer, navigate to the folder where SMB3 Randomizer is installed.
3. Click "Surprise Me!" to generate a random flagset. The program will automatically decide on the flags and generate a randomized rom for you.
4. Enjoy! 

How it works:

Flags included in the randomization:

Shuffle Regular Stages (75% chance)
Add Lost Levels (75% chance)
Shuffle Fortresses (75% chance)
Shuffle World 8 Ships (50% chance)
Shuffle Castles (50% chance)
Random Hammer Bros Levels (50% chance)
Shuffle World Locations (75% chance)
Level Appearance (50% chance. If selected 50% chance between All ?'s and All Hands)
Change Forts as Well (75% chance if Level Appearance is changed)
Shuffle Overworld Pipes (50% chance)
Shuffle World Order (75% chance)
Make Levels Frog Friendly (Guaranteed if required by Permanent Mario Status, 50% chance otherwise)

Randomize Enemies (75% chance)
Randomize Koopa Earthquakes (75% chance)
Randomize Koopa Kid HP (50% chance)
Randomize Hammer Bros (75% chance)

Randomize N Game Prizes (50% chance)
Randomize Castle Items (50% chance)
Randomize Anchor Ability (75% chance)
Randomize Item Blocks (50% chance)
Remove N Game (50% chance)
Shuffle chest Items (50% chance)
Shuffle Toad Houses (50% chance)
Let Hammers Break Locks (50% chance)

One Hit Knockout (25% chance if selected)
Permanent Mario Status (50% chance if selected, 20% chance each for Fire, Frog, Tanooki, and Hammer Mario. 13% chance for Raccoon Mario, 7% chance for Big Mario)


Flags NOT included in the randomization:

Remove Some Autoscrollers (Always checked - No one likes them right? :p)
Remove Ship Autoscrollers (Always checked - See above)
Shuffle Warp Zones (Always unchecked)

Shuffle N Game (Always checked - In vanilla there are only 8 combinations so it'd be too easy to clean them out otherwise)
Remove Warp Whistles (Always checked - For obvious reasons)


Note that vanilla-like scenarios may still arise, but thanks to these calculated odds (plus internal checks) the randomization should prevent generated flagsets from being 'too' vanilla.

Enjoy!
